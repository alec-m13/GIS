This repository is for practice learning how GIS systems work.

My plan is to follow the CDC tutorial [here](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/gisx/training/index.html) but using [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) instead of ArcGIS. Hopefully it turns out ok, here we go.

I will not be including the actual GIS data in this repository, both because that would be an unnecessary use of GitHub's storage and beacuse these data can be licensed in ways which I don't want to deal with. Instead in each folder which contains GIS data which I use, I will add a text file with a link to the source of the data.

I will use this repository's wiki as a progress blog.
